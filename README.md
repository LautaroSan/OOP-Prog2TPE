# OOP-Prog2TPE
  This Project was developed alongside a classmate for a College Subject focused on OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It models a Reality Show with different types of judges and participants. 
  It includes of course all the basics  of OOP and some advanced concepts and uses (polymorphism, interfaces, inheritance).  Besides that, it also includes Strategy as Pattern Design in order to filter and compare several participants, and Composite Pattern Design.
